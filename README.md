## Description
While [bit iterators](https://github.com/vreverdy/bit) are currently being proposed and reviewed by the ISO C++ Standards Committee, this repository is intended for practical use of bit containers and algorithms based on bit iterators. Primarily, this repository acts as an efficient replacement of `std::vector<bool>`. It provides implementations of many of the functions in `<algorithms>` optimized for containers of bits, in addition to providing a `bitvector` class, which has the same interface as `std::vector<bool>`.

Many of the implementations in `include/bit-algorithms` come from some of my previous work [here](https://github.com/vreverdy/bit-algorithms), however that repository is also somewhat frozen, as it is tied to the ISO C++ Standards Committee proposal as well. In addition, it contains many overloads that are likely less practical (like forward lists of bits). 

## Example
```
#include <iostream>
#include "bit-iterator/bit.hpp"
#include "bit-algorithms/bit_algorithm.hpp"
#include "bit-containers/bitvector.hpp"


int main() {
    bit::bit_vector<unsigned char> bv1 {"01001010010"};
    std::cout << bv1 << std::endl;
    return 0;
}

// Will output
// 01001010 010
```


## Performance Benchmarks
I used Google's [benchmark](https://github.com/google/benchmark) library for computing benchmarks. Each benchmark is formatted as `{bit, std}::function` (size) [(alignment-tags)].

* `bit` is for this library, `std` is the standard library operating on the infamous `vector<bool>`. 
* (size) denotes the size of the container in bits. `small = 1 << 4`, `large = 1 << 16`
* (alignment-tags) refers to the memory alignment of the bit-iterators. `U` means the iterator does not fall on a word boundary, `R` means the iterator is placed at random, and `A` means the iterator is aligned with a word boundary.

For example, `bit::rotate (large) (ARA)` refers to our library's implementation of the `rotate` algorithm operating on a container of 32768 bits, where `first` and `last` are aligned but `n_first` is selected at random.

## Style
Every source file follows a strict layout. If you are a contributor please make sure you follow this common style.
* C++ files
    * Indentation: 4 spaces
    * Line width: 80 characters
    * Separators: every file is divided in parts, these parts being delimited by separators
        * Separator styles:
            * 1: `// ========================================================================== //`
            * 2: `/* ************************************************************************** */`
            * 3: `// -------------------------------------------------------------------------- //`
        * Separator styles description:
            * 1: general purpose
            * 2: declarations and types, classes, structures
            * 3: implementation
        * Each section begins with a separator and a title
        * The title is in capital letters, centered, with a white space before and after, without underscores
        * Each section ends with a separator
        * Sections are separated by 3 lines
    * Class members: class members are grouped together
        * Each group corresponds to a category of members (eg: `Types`, `Lifecycle`, `Access`, `Operators`...)
        * In the class definition, each group starts with a comment with the name of the group
        * Each group specifies the class access modifier (eg: public, protected, private)
        * Groups related to implementation details are marked by `Implementation details`
        * The separator titles should specify the path of the group they correspond to:
            * `CLASS NAME: GROUP NAME`, `
            * `CLASS NAME: IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS: GROUP NAME`
    * Every file starts with the following information:
        * `// =============================== FILE NAME ================================ //`
        * `// Project:         The Experimental Bit Algorithms Library`
        * `// Name:            file_name.hpp`
        * `// Description:     1 line description of the file`

        * The alignment of the second column is 20
    * Every file is followed by a preamble, typically for file inclusion:
        * `// ================================ PREAMBLE ================================ //`
        * `// C++ standard library`
        * `#include <something>` (if any)
